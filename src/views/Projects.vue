                    <p>This project was initially conceived at a hackathon, where my team and I first developed the idea using PHP. It worked, but in the next IPT 5.1, we decided to restart the project, focusing more on the frontend. Our efforts paid off, as we received a grade of 5.5 for our work.</p>

                    <p>The Expense Manager is designed to track users' spending and set budgets for different categories. For IPT 6.1, my team and I developed this project using C# and an SQLite database. We came up with this creative idea to help users better manage their finances, and we worked on everything from planning to implementation.</p>
